Voice Commands
</title>
<body>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The speech commands of LCARS x32 allow you to control many features of LCARS x32 by voice, as well as add your own commands. While it cannot approach the natural language recognition seen in Star Trek, it does permit simple commands. Command complexity will be increased in later versions, so you will be able to set up and initiate that auto-destruct sequence entirely by voice.</p>
<p>The speech function is  very much still in development. If you choose to use speech commands unexpected results sometimes occur or your computer may unexpectedly log off or close a program. On-going issues are being addressed as the software is refined but it is a long process with no guarantee that it will ever be 100% perfect. We suggest turning off the speech option if unexpected situations arise with speech enabled.</p>
<h3><a name="SpeechConsole"></a>Speech Console</h3>
<p>The speech console was added in version 0.6.1. It keeps a list of all commands that the computer has heard and recognized, provides a list of internal commands that can be used, allows commands to be entered manually, and can enable or disable recognition altogether. This bundles the former functionality of several components into a single window. It can be shown or hidden by voice command, or by clicking the "Speech" button on any main screen.</p>
<p>In the event that speech recognition is not working as intended, examine the output on the speech console for discrepancies. Some misrecognitions are normal, particularly if there is a lot of background noise.</p>
<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>The voice commands feature switches the speech function on and off. A Speech on-off button is also provided on each of the primary desktops so that the feature can be enabled or disabled quickly.</p>
<p>If speech is working properly on your system and the function is enabled in LCARS x32, the computer will warble when you say the word "Computer" If it does not, you may need to change the language code. Just type the new code and click "Save Changes". In the UK the code should be 809, in the US it's 409.</p>
<h3>Editing Commands</h3>
<p>Voice commands are divided into internal and external commands. Internal commands are built into LCARS x32, and can only be renamed using a command alias. They are accessed by clicking the button marked "Internal Commands". Select the command you wish to rename and type in the new name.</p>
<p>External commands are handled similarly to Personal Programs. They consist of a name, which is what is said to run them, and an executable path. Be sure that you do not use the same name as an internal command. The internal command will override any external command.</p>
<p>When you are done editing the voice commands, be sure to click "Save Changes". If you remove a custom command, there is a chance that the command will still be recognized, though it will not function.</p>

<h3>Technical Information</h3>
<p>LCARS x32 uses a static xml file to create its voice command grammar. This file is re-generated every time the speech commands are initialized. While this will probably be upgraded to a dynamically declared grammar, much of the current system is designed to work around the limitations of this. All command aliases and custom commands are stored in the registry.</p>
