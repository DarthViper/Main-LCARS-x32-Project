Main Screens
</title>
<body>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The interface you first see when starting LCARS x32 is the main screen. This screen controls most functions of LCARS x32 including application switching, tray icons, personal programs, and the start menu. There are four main screens included with LCARS x32, and you can switch between them at any time by clicking the "Mode Select" button. See the <a href="Quick Reference.htm">quick reference</a> for a brief summery of what each button does on the default main screen.</p>
<h3><a name="StartMenu"></a>Start Menu</h3>

<p>The start menus shown at right differ depending upon which LCARS x32 screen is in use.</p>
<p>They all have very similar arrangements which include access to LCARS x32 features and settings as well as access to your programs.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the start menu the number of pages is shown and clicking the right or left arrow moves you forward and backwards through them.</p>
<p>The start menu, once visible is hidden again by clicking Start Menu button.</p>
<p>The content of each users start menu will vary considerably in accordance with the application you have installed. The number of buttons and the way in which they are arranged also varies from one screen to another. You will need to explore your start menu too see what is included on your particular computer.</p>
<h3><a name="PersonalPrograms"></a>Personal Programs</h3>
<img src="Images/Personal.png" />
<p>As well as the start menu it was realised early in the development of LCARS x32 that shortcuts would be missed by some users. Icons have no place in an LCARS environment however so the Personal Programs System was created.</p>
<p>The personal programs system consists of two parts, the actual buttons used to start the programs and the area where the personal programs are managed and organised. The graphic below shows the personal programs menu and personal buttons manager screen open.</p>
<p>To create a personal program button shortcut, click "Personal Programs" followed by "Manage Your Programs"</p>
<p>Next, type a name for the Button and a command that will start the program. This is normally a path to an exe file and you can browse to the required exe using the button marked "..." to the right of the Command text box.</p>
<p>Next click OK to complete the procedure.</p>
<p>To remove a button highlight the item in the list and click "remove".</p>
<p>Click "Done" to close the Personal Buttons Manager.</p>
<h3><a name="TrayIcons"></a>Tray Icons</h3>
<p>Although Icons are not really suitable for an LCARS environment, it is necessary sometimes to access the icons that normally appear in the windows tray. Clicking the "SHOW TRAY ICONS" button will open the tray icons menu and make the icons visible should you need them.</p>
