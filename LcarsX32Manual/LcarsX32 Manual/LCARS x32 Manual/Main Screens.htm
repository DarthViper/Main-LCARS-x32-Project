Main Screens
</title>
<body>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The interface you first see when starting LCARS x32 is the main screen. This screen controls most functions of LCARS x32 including application switching, tray icons, personal programs, and the start menu. There are four main screens included with LCARS x32, and you can switch between them at any time by clicking the "Mode Select" button. See the <a href="Quick Reference.htm">quick reference</a> for a brief summery of what each button does on the default main screen.</p>
<p>Each screen includes a Start Menu button which used to access applications as well as some or all of the LCARS x32 functions, depending upon which screen is visible. Running applications are also displayed via tabs on each screen and can be minimised by clicking the appropriate tab or closed by clicking the adjacent cross. These tabs are the LCARS x32 taskbar icons and represent the running program tabs you would see in a windows environment. The UFP Logo (or your choice of wallpaper) is positioned in the LCARS x32 “working area” which is the section in which your running applications run.</p>
<p>Each main screen has a different layout. Some are designed to have as much easily accessed as possible, at the expense of screen space. Another is designed to hide as much as possible for maximum screen space. Yet another is designed to replicate a particular bridge console. Which one you use is entirely up to you. In some cases, there is a method of hiding the upper section of the screen. For the default main screen, there will sometimes be features not implemented on other screens. This is because those features are still being tested and will be added to all the main screens when judged stable.</p>
<p>The four main screens are version 1, the original layout, version 2, which is based on Data's bridge console on Enterprise NCC1701D, version 3, which simulates a windows layout and version 4 which features buttons at the top of the screen.</p>
<h3><a name="StartMenu"></a>Start Menu</h3>

<p>The four main screens are shown at right with their start menus open. Each one has access to the programs that would be shown in the Windows Start menu, but the LCARS features in each one vary depending on the screen.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the start menu the number of pages is shown and clicking the right or left arrow moves you forward and backwards through them.</p>
<p>The start menu is opened and can be hidden again by clicking the Start Menu button.</p>
<h3><a name="PersonalPrograms"></a>Personal Programs</h3>
<img src="Images/Personal.png" />
<p>As well as the start menu it was realised early in the development of LCARS x32 that shortcuts would be missed by some users. Icons have no place in an LCARS environment however so the Personal Programs System was created.</p>
<p>The personal programs system consists of two parts, the actual buttons used to start the programs and the area where the personal programs are managed and organised. The graphic below shows the personal programs menu and personal buttons manager screen open.</p>
<p>To create a personal program button shortcut, click "Personal Programs" followed by "Manage Your Programs"</p>
<p>Next, type a name for the Button and a command that will start the program. This is normally a path to an exe file or any valid command line. You can browse to the required exe using the button marked "..." to the right of the Command text box.</p>
<p>Next click OK to complete the procedure.</p>
<p>To remove a button highlight the item in the list and click "remove".</p>
<p>Click "Done" to close the Personal Buttons Manager.</p>
<h3><a name="TrayIcons"></a>Tray Icons</h3>
<p>Although Icons are not really suitable for an LCARS environment, it is necessary sometimes to access the icons that normally appear in the windows tray. Clicking the "SHOW TRAY ICONS" button will open the tray icons menu and make the icons visible should you need them.</p>
<p>Important note: Because LCARS x32 does not yet implement its own tray icons, it borrows them from Windows Explorer. This means that if Windows Explorer is not running tray icons cannot be displayed. Windows Explorer is not running if LCARS x32 is set to be the default shell, so there are no tray icons in shell mode despite the fact that all auto-start programs have been loaded.</p>
