<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<img src="Images/X32Logo.gif" />
<p>LCARS x32 is a freeware project originally conceived and created by Raymond Philips, a very talented computer software engineer and fan of the Star Trek TV shows. Raymond lives and works in the United States.</p>
<p>The LCARS x32 system is based upon the LCARS (Library Computer Access Retrieval System) designed by Michael Okuda for Paramount’s 7 season TV series, Star Trek The Next Generation.</p>
<p>Raymond’s goal was to produce a fully functional LCARS style interface. Most implementations of LCARS are all flash with little or no real world functionality but LCARS x32 is different. It has the look and feel of LCARS but is designed to be used on a daily basis as a working personal computer shell.</p>
<p>You won’t find star ship images, warp core analysis or stellar cartography graphics in LCARS x32. An LCARS project would not be complete though without a small nod to the show so LCARS x32 includes an Auto Destruct and Red Alert function both of which have an element of fun alongside the practical functions they have or will provide.</p>
<h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p>Ray developed his first stable release back in 2008 which is still available on the LCARS x32 Website, <a href="http://www.lcarsx32.com" target="_new">www.lcarsx32.com</a>.
<p>His on-going aim was to issue a weekly update that included improvements and modifications to the code that improved stability and increased the number of functions available.</p>
<p>Slowly, following the release of some publicity including some You Tube videos, a small but dedicated fan base who appreciated the work Ray was doing, joined what has now become the LCARS x32 Community.</p>
<p>College and work commitments eventually made it difficult for Ray to continue developing LCARS x32 on his own and after a short break, other community members picked up the reigns and development continued.</p>
<p>The community is presently working towards the release of a working stable Beta and in the mean time pre-beta releases are available for people that are willing to take a chance and try it for themselves.</p>
<h2>LIABILITY</h2>
<p>Please note that the LCARS x32 community cannot accept any responsibility for any problems, failures, loss or work or any other consequential losses that arise as a result of your use of the LCARS x32 system.</p>
<p><strong>You install the software entirely at your own risk!</strong></p>
<p>The community does provide lots of help and guidance via the LCARS x32 website forums and the software has been used daily on PC’s running Windows operating systems ranging from 98 to Windows 7 without any serious issues.</p>
<p>LCARS x32 is freeware, issued as is, with no guarantees whatsoever. Everybody who wants to is welcome to try the software as long as you are willing to accept the consequences in the event that problems arise on your PC!</p>
<p>LCARS x32 is not endorsed by Paramount Pictures or its affiliates, the CBS network or its affiliates or by any individual connected with the TV shows or the above corporations.</p>
<h2>USING THE HELP SCREEN</h2>
<p>The LCARS x32 help screen is designed to assist you in finding your way around the application and familiarise you with the various functions within the shell.</p>
<p>The help screen is flexible and can be moved around anywhere on your desktop by clicking, holding and dragging the top left elbow.</p>
<p>You can alter the height of the help screen by clicking and dragging the bottom left elbow. If you click and drag the long LCARS rectangle on the left of the screen you can alter the width of the LCARS screen.</p>
<p>The settings you choose including the position, width and height of the screen are stored in the system so that the next time you display help it will be in the same position in which you left it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTERS</h2>
<p>The Help screen consists of several chapters as shown in the bottom right hand corner of the LCARS screen. You can select any chapter you like by clicking the appropriate button. The Function buttons above the graphics will change from chapter to chapter so that you can select particular images that are relevant to the section that you are reading at any particular time.</p>
