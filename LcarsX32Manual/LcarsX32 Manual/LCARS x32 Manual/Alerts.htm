Alerts
</title>
<body>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>Alerts are one of the features of LCARS x32 that were originally just a nod to Star Trek, but has now been expanded so that it serves a useful function. Alerts can now be used by any program to give information when needed. They can also be configured by the user to display in any manner that is desired.</p>
<p>All settings for all alerts are under the "Alerts" tab of the settings program. The sound for the red alert was formerly under "Sounds", but has been moved as of 0.6 to this tab so that all alerts can be configured in one place.</p>
<p>The name of an alert and it's ID are not configurable because they can be used by programs to access an alert, so if you accidentally create an alert with the wrong name, it must be deleted and re-created to use a new name. There is no guarantee that the index will remain the same. Red and yellow alerts are system-defined and cannot be deleted without damaging the functionality of LCARS x32, so deletion through Settings is disabled. If these alerts are somehow deleted by an outside program, they will be re-created with the correct indexes the next time LCARS x32 starts.</p>
<p>The only options that are configured when an alert is created is its name and ID. The sound to play (if any) and the color to display should be configured after creation. The color defaults to a horrible shade of magenta to remind you to change it. The name should not contain "alert"; it will be added to the end automatically. Any changes made in the alerts tab will be automatically saved.</p>
<p>If an installed program has created an alert, you may change its color or sound without modifying its functionality. However, deleting the alert may cause problems if the program has not been designed to handle this.</p>
<h2>Alerts Browser</h2>
<p>The alerts browser allows you to activate any alert that has been created, and cancel any current alerts. It is generally accessed by clicking an arrow button next to the alert button on the main screen. The alert button that is visible on the default main screens will cancel any current alert or activate a red alert if no other alert is operating. You do not need to deactivate the current alert to activate a new alert; the first will be automatically deactivated.</p>
<h2>Technical Information</h2>
<p>For the purposes of LCARS x32, or any program using LCARS x32's alerts, an alert is an ID, a name, a colour, and an (optional) sound. The name and ID may both be used to access a particular alert, and as such are not permitted to be changed after an alert has been created. The alert name is the name to display to users and use to access the alert. The alert ID is the internal integer used to transmit the alert over the window-messaging system.</p>
<p>For simplicity, LCARS x32 does not support displaying a message with the alert. The program activating an alert is responsible for displaying any relevant message. Keep in mind that there is no stack for activated alerts, so activating an alert clears any other alert that was currently operating. This behaviour may be changed in future versions of LCARS x32.</p>
<p>If desired, alerts can be manually edited in the registry, however doing so may cause unexpected behaviour. They are stored under HKCU:\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings\LCARS x32\Alerts . The key name is the alert index, with a value containing the alert name, color, and sound path. Do not attempt to change the name or ID of the red or yellow alerts. They will be reset the next time LCARS x32 starts.</p>
