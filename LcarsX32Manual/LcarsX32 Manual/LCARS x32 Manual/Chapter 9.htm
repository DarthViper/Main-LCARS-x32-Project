<p>The LcarsX32 Web Browser is a fully function tabbed browser based on Internet Explorer. The LcarsX32 Browser will not function if Internet Explorer is missing or not working on your system.</p>
<p>It has all the regular features you would expect including an address bar, forward, back, stop and go buttons, a zoom button to increase the size of those annoying websites that insist of using very small fonts, a tab close, new tab and home button as well as a visual display to indicate the status of the web page loading progress.</p>
<p>The home page is your primary Internet Explorer home page. This keeps the home page on both browsers synchronised at all times. If you want to change your home page, simply alter the primary home page in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Also included in the left hand button menu is a bookmarks option. If you find a website that you like and want to keep a link to it, clicking the bookmark button will bring up the bookmarks menu in which you can save your link.</p>
<p>You can see a picture of the bookmarks menu by pressing the BOOKMARK button below.</p>
<h3>BOOKMARKS</h3>

<p>The bookmarks menu consists of a screen in which your bookmark urls are kept as well as five functional buttons. Bookmark URL will add the URL on your current tab to the bookmarks list. The current tab url always displays in the address bar at the top of the browser.</p>
<p>Selecting a bookmark and clicking the “Delete Bookmark” button will delete the bookmark from the list.</p>
<p>Double clicking a bookmark will send the url to your current tab and close the bookmark menu.</p>
<p>The Other buttons on the bookmarks menu are used to delete all the bookmarks in your list or import all the bookmarks in url format from Internet Explorer. The potential to accidently delete yourr bookmarks and the problems that could cause are obvious so the buttons are locked and cannot be clicked until they are unlocked.</p>
<p>To unlock the critical functions click the “Lock Unlock Critical Functions” button however we recommend leaving them locked at all times unless you are setting up your bookmarks for the first time or want to delete everything and start over.</p>
