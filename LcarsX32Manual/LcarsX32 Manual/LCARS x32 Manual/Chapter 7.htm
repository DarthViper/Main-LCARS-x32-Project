On Screen Keyboard (OSK)
</title>
<body>

<p>Because Lcars is predominantly a touch based interface it would not be complete without a suitable on screen keyboard (OSK) and Lcarsx32 includes just such a feature.</p>
<p>The Lcars OSK is an advanced touch sensitive on screen keyboard which includes a number of useful features not found on many, if any, similar keyboards. These includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sizeable width and height with memory function.</li>
<li>Programmable function keys for shortcuts.</li>
<li>Caps, Number and Scroll lock keys synchronised with the main keyboard regardless of where the function is toggled.</li>
<li>A windows key with short clicks for Windows start menu access or long clicks for latch function to enable shortcuts. Even the default MS on screen keyboard doesn’t do this!</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be moved anywhere on the desktop and just like the Windows version; it remembers where it was left.</p>
<p>The Numbers pad can be switched on or off by clicking the “Num” button next to the “Resize KeyPad” button.</p>
<p>To move the keyboard, click and hold the “Move Keyboard” button and drag the OSK to the required position. Release the mouse when positioned as required.</p>

<p>To resize the keyboard click the “Resize Keypad” button. The following screen should appear:</p>
<p>The resize pad can be moved on screen by clicking and holding the “Move” button then dragging the pad to the required desktop position.</p>
<p>You can set the increment and decrement size in pixels by clicking the + and – buttons beneath the pixels label. As shown, pressing the + or – buttons for width or height increases or decreases the size by 20 pixels per click.</p>
<p>Please note that the OSK is displayed in full size mode when altering its width and height.</p>
<p>When you are happy with the keyboard size press OK.</p>

<p>To program a function button click the “FN LOCK/UNLOCK button. The FN button will change color and can now be clicked to display the following pad:</p>
<p>This pad can be moved around on screen by clicking and holding the “MOVE” button then dragging the pad to the required desktop position.</p>
<p>To program a function button, type a short 3 letter name code in the required field then add a command to the Command field. This will normally be a path to an exe. You can also browse to an exe using the browse button.</p>
<p>Next, click the function button you want tom program such as FN1 then click OK on the Functions Button Pad to complete the process.</p>
<p>You can program up to 12 Function buttons.</p>
<h3>WINDOWS KEY.</h3>
<p>A short click (less than 0.5 seconds long) on the windows key will bring up your Windows Start Menu.</p>
<p>A longer click (More than 0,5 seconds) will latch the Windows function on so that you can then click another key such “A” for a Windows + A Shortcut for example.</p>
<p>Repeating a long click will cancel the Windows latch function.</p>
<h3>ALT KEY</h3>
<p>The Alt key toggles on and off. It has a maximum timed ten second latch so that initiating special functions such as Alt and Tab to access particular windows causes the alt function to cancel automatically should the keyboard be temporarily unavailable or hidden.</p>
<h3>HIDDEN</h3>
<p>The keyboard can be hidden by pressing the “Hide” Button. Click the LcarsX32 OSK tab to make the keyboard re-appear.</p>
