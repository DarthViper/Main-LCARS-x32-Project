Setting Up
</title>
<body>
<h2>SETTINGS MENU</h2>
<p>We recommend installing the latest incremental build before following the instructions which follow.</p>
<p>Lcars includes 4 primary screens, one of which is shown (Click for larger image) below.</p>
<img src="Images/Primary.png" />
<p>Each screen includes a Start Menu button which used to access applications as well as some or all of the LcarsX32 functions, depending upon which screen is visible. Running applications are also displayed via tabs on each screen and can be minimised by clicking the appropriate tab or closed by clicking the adjacent cross. These tabs are the LcarsX32 taskbar icons and represent the running program tabs you would see in a windows environment.</p>
<p>Primary screens include version 1, the original layout, version 2, which is based on Data’s bridge console on Enterprise NCC1701D, version 3, which simulates a windows layout and version 4 which features buttons at the top of the screen. All four can be seen in chapter 4 with their corresponding start menus visible.</p>
<p>The UFP Logo is positioned in the Lcarsx32 “working area” which is the section in which your running applications run.</p>
<h2>SETTINGS</h2>
<p>You need to click the Settings button to proceed that will either be visible on screen or can be accessed by clicking the Lcarsx32 start menu button.</p>
<p>On the right side of the Settings screen are a number of tabs. The current tab is highlighted. Tabs include:</p>
<ol>
<li>SOUNDS</li>
<li>APPEARANCE</li>
<li>STARTUP</li>
<li>DESKTOP</li>
<li>VOICE COMMANDS</li>
<li>ABOUT</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see a picture of the first five screens by clicking the appropriate button below.</p>
<h2>SOUNDS</h2>
<img src="Images/Sounds.png" />
<p>The first option you will be presented with is the sound settings feature. Each Lcarsx32 button beeps when clicked or touched (if you have a touch screen) and this feature is switched on or off using the button marked “Button Beeping”</p>
<p>You can also change the sound file used for the button beeps or red alert siren by clicking the button marked “change” next to that file’s path. Any “.wav” file can be used for these sounds.</p>
<h2>APPEARANCE</h2>
<img src="Images/Appearance.png" />
<p>The appearance tab is used to set the preferred color scheme, the default language that changes the text displayed on labels and buttons and the “Use Star date” feature that controls the clock display.</p>
<p>A choice of colour scheme is included and clicking a scheme in the list will alter the key above and show you what you can expect Lcarsx32 to look like. You may need to re-start Lcarsx32 to initiate your chosen colors.</p>
<p>An editor is available which allows you to create your own color schemes. It is called Colormapper and is available from the incremental build section of the Download area in the Lcarsx32 website.</p>
<p>The language alters the labelling of buttons and functions within Lcarsx32. When you click a language in the list, a key above will change to show you how the buttons and functions will look.</p>
<p>A new language file can be created using an editor available at the LCARS resource site where the current release is hosted.</p>
<p>The “Use Star date” Button changes the clock display. With the mode OFF the current day, month, year and time are displayed. With the feature switched on the current star date is displayed.</p>
<h2>STARTUP</h2>
<img src="Images/Startup.png" />
<p>The start-up tab is used to set the preferred screen when Lcarsx32 starts up. It also enables the user to decide if they want to use Lcarsx32 as the default shell or Windows explorer.</p>
<p>Users who prefer to use windows explorer as the default shell can do so and Lcarsx32 will function as a replacement desktop that can be activated and de-activated as required.</p>
<p>The Auto hide feature is used when full screen mode for applications is required. The Lcarsx32 menu buttons and display are largely hidden unless the mouse is moved off screen.</p>
<h2>DESKTOP</h2>
<img src="Images/Desktop.png" />
<p>The desktop feature is used to set up the default working area desktop display. You can use the United Federation of Planets Logo that is included with the software or you can use your own wallpaper instead.</p>
<p>Zoom, stretch, center and tile options are provided to help you position your wallpaper.</p>
<h2>VOICE COMMANDS</h2>
<img src="Images/Voice.png" />
<p>The voice commands feature switches the speech function on and off. A Speech on-off button is also provided on each of the primary desktops so that the feature can be enabled or disabled quickly.</p>
<p>If speech is working properly on your system and the function is enabled in Lcarsx32, the computer will warble when you say the word “Computer” If it does not, you may need to change the language code. Just type the new code and click “Save Changes”. In the UK the code should be 809, in the US it’s 409.</p>
<h3>Editing Commands</h3>
<p>Voice commands are divided into internal and external commands. Internal commands are built into LCARS x32, and can only be renamed using a command alias. They are accessed by clicking the button marked “Internal Commands”. Select the command you wish to rename and type in the new name.</p>
<p>External commands are handled similarly to Personal Programs. They consist of a name, which is what is said to run them, and an executable path. Be sure that you do not use the same name as an internal command. The internal command will override any external command.</p>
<p>When you are done editing the voice commands, be sure to click “Save Changes”. If you remove a custom command, there is a chance that the command will still be recognized, though it will not function.</p>

</table>
<p>The speech function is probably the most complicated feature in Lcarsx32 and for the moment, very much still in development. If you choose to use speech commands unexpected results sometimes occur or your computer may unexpectedly log off or close a program.</p>
<p>On-going issues are being addressed as the software is refined but it is a long process with no guarantee that it will ever be 100% perfect. We suggest turning off the speech option if unexpected situations arise with speech enabled.</p>
<h2>UPDATE</h2>
<p>Auto-updates are designed to simplify the distribution of bugfixes and new features. Normally no settings on this page will need to be changed. LCARS x32 will check for updates at startup, or whenever the "Manal Check" button is clicked. Depending on what type of build you installed, LCARS x32 will be configured to check either the experimental or stable release update channels. At this time, there is no stable release with updates, so that option is disabled. It is important to note that you MUST have administator access to install updates.</p>
<p>There is an option to install updates from a custom update server. Any updates installed in this manner are the property of their creators, and are installed at your own risk! If you wish to set up your own custom update server, please make a request through the forums at www.lcarsx32.com.</p>
<h2>EXPERIMENTAL</h2>
<p>Any options which are considered highly unpredictable will be placed here. Any documentation of those functions will be on their settings screen. All experimental functions are off by default, and may operate with unpredictable results when turned on. Unless you have a specific reason to, DO NOT use these functions.</p>
