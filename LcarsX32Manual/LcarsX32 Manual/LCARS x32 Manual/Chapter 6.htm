Personal Programs Menu

<p>As well as the start menu it was realised early in the development of Lcarsx32 that shortcuts would be missed by some users. Icons have no place in an Lcars environment however so the Personal Programs System was created.</p>
<p>The personal programs system consists of two parts, the actual buttons used to start the programs and the area where the personal programs are managed and organised. The graphic below shows the personal programs menu and personal buttons manager screen open.</p>
<p>To create a personal program button shortcut, click “Personal Programs” followed by “Manage Your Programs”</p>
<p>Next, type a name for the Button and a command that will start the program. This is normally a path to an exe file and you can browse to the required exe using the button marked “...” to the right of the Command text box.</p>
<p>Next click OK to complete the procedure.</p>
<p>To remove a button highlight the item in the list and click “remove”.</p>
<p>Click “Done” to close the Personal Buttons Manager.</p>
<h3>ICONS</h3>
<p>Although Icons are not really suitable for an Lcars environment, it is necessary sometimes to access the icons that normally appear in the windows tray. Clicking the “SHOW TRAY ICONS” button will open the tray icons menu and make the icons visible should you need them.</p>
