<p>The LcarsX32 Engineering display extracts information from the computer including OS facts, memory & CPU usage and displays them in the Engineering screen.</p>
<p>Lots of information is provided in a simple, easy to read list.</p>
<p>Although this function is currently rather limited in scope, it is envisaged that it will eventually evolve into a more comprehensive display where drive parameters, custom system graphics and a host of other related information will be available. Engineering is at present, very much still in the early stages of development.</p>
