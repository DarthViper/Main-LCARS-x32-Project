<p>The LcarsX32 Picture viewer is used to view individual images, pictures and photo collections.</p>
<p>It consists of a main viewing screen and function buttons used to browse through photo collections, set up a slide show and zoom in or out of your images.</p>
<p>Information about each image is presented in the top right hand corner of the viewer.</p>
<p>To access your photos click the browse button then select your photo folder/s to access the pictures you require.</p>
<p>If you want to access an individual image you can set the picture viewer as the default application for your pictures extension then double click the image to load it into the viewer. The image information is not displayed in this instance.</p>
<p>If you load a collection of images you can activate a 5 second slide show by clicking the “Start Slide Show” button. The button changes to a “Stop Slide Show” button once the slide show is active.</p>
<p>You can load a number of collections by loading one set from a folder then repeating the procedure to load the images from another folder.</p>
<p>You need to close and re-start the viewer to empty the loaded photo collection/s and start again.</p>
<p>The navigation array is used to rotate images (up and down arrows) and to move forward or backwards through your loaded collection manually (left arrow button to go back, right to go forward).</p>
<p>The rectangular buttons adjacent to each arrow button are used to move an image around in the viewing window when you zoom into the image. To move up the image press the rectangle below the up arrow. To move left on the image press the rectangle next to the left arrow. Holding a rectangle button down will move through the image more quickly.</p>
<p>To re-size the image to its normal full view press the button marked “Full”.</p>
<p>The current zoom factor is shown in the window above the navigation array. Please note that very large images that are much bigger than the resolution of your desktop are zoomed to less than 100% as required to fully fit the viewing screen. This will be reflected in the zoom percentage displayed.</p>
