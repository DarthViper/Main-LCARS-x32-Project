<body>
<p>A number of Add-On Lcars applications are available via the Lcarsx32 website. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Lcars Scientific Calculator</li>
<li>Radios</li>
<li>Media Players</li>
<li>Star Trek Database</li>
<li>Language File Manager (Editor for LcarsX32 Language File)</li>
<li>Managers</li>
</ul>
<p>Lcarsx32 is all about proper functionality for the control and day to day use of a personal Computer running Windows operating systems. Clearly though, it is inspired by the TV show “Star Trek the Next Generation” and the community welcomes the development of any Star Trek based application as a stand alone add-on for the Lcarsx32 environment.</p>
<p>The Lcars buttons and graphics used throughout the Lcarsx32 shell are available for download from the website so that developers can use them to create fun and interesting applications.</p>
<p>Have fun with Lcars and see what you can come up with. Join the community and post news about your apps in the Jupiter Station Forum which can be found on the Lcars website.</p>
