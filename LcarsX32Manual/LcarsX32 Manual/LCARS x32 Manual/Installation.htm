<h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
<img src="Images/Website.png" />
<p>LCARS x32 requires several other pieces of software to work correctly. The .NET framework v2.0 is required for all LCARS programs built to work with LCARS x32 and for x32 itself. However, you  will only need to install it if you are not using Windows Vista or higher. Windows 8 users may need to install the .NET framework v3.5, which will include v2.0 if it is not already installed. For users of XP and below, the .NET framework v2.0 may be downloaded from the LCARS x32 website under the prerequisites section of the download page.</p>
<p>The LCARS font, while not strictly required to use LCARS x32, is required to view text properly. If you have installed the latest incremental build with an installer, the font will be automatically installed, though it may not function properly until your system has been restarted. If you have downloaded the archive version, then there should be a copy in the archive to install.</p>
<p>Speech recognition in LCARS x32 requires the MS Speech API version 5.1 or above. Depending on your computer, this may already be installed. To check, go to the Windows Control Panel in icon view and look for an icon labelled "Speech Recognition". If you are not planning on using LCARS x32's voice commands, there is no need to install this. Important note: You will have to have set up and trained the speech recognizer with the microphone you plan to use with LCARS x32 before LCARS x32's voice commands will function. You do not need to have Windows speech recognition running to use LCARS x32's voice commands.</p>

<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>
<p>The recommended version is currently the latest incremental build. The stable releases are now less stable than the current build, though there are bugs in the incremental build too. Keep in mind that there is not yet a full 1.0 release of LCARS x32, nor is there any guarantee that there are no bugs introduced by newer builds.</p>
<p>To install the latest incremental builds, either extract the zip archive to the folder of your choosing and run LCARSmain.exe or download and run the installer. There is no advantage to either method. If LCARS x32 operates in an unusual manner or fails to display any text, restart your system.</p>
