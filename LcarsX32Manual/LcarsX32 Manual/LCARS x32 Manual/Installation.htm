<h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
<img src="Images/Website.png" />
<p>LCARS x32 requires a number of add-ons to work properly on your computer. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>dotnetfx2.exe</li>
<li>MS Speech API 5.1</li>
<li>Lcars_Font</li>
</ol>
<p>All three are available from the LCARS x32 website at www.lcarsx32.com. The image below (Click for larger image) shows the menu feature on the website where you can download the required applications.</p>
<p>You will need to install each of the above if they are not already installed on your system. Windows Vista and higher users will not need to install dotnetfx2.exe as the .NET framework is already installed on those systems. LCARS x32 will function without MS Speech, but the voice commands will not work.</p>
<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>
<p>We recommend installing the stable releases first so you can make sure everything is working at it should. Both version 1.0.4 and 1.1 are pre-beta releases and some functions do not operate or operate with unexpected results.</p>
<p>Once you have established that LCARS x32 is running satisfactorily, you can download the latest incremental build that includes the latest features and is the most up to date version of the software available.</p>
<p>In most cases you will need to manually unzip the software and copy the files into the folder in which the stable release was installed. Alternatively, there will be an installer to run.</p>
