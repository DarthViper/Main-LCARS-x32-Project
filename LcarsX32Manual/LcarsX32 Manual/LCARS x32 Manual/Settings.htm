<h2>General</h2>
<p>The following instructions apply to the latest incremental build only.</p>
<h2>SETTINGS</h2>
<p>You need to click the Settings button to proceed that will either be visible on screen or can be accessed by clicking the LCARS x32 start menu button. Alternatively, the program LCARSsettings.exe may be launched from LCARS x32's install location to edit settings without requiring LCARS x32 to be running. This could be helpful if you need to fix something that is preventing you from starting LCARS x32.</p>
<p>On the right side of the Settings screen are a number of tabs. The current tab is highlighted. Tabs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SOUNDS</li>
<li>APPEARANCE</li>
<li>SCREEN-SPECIFIC</li>
<li>STARTUP</li>
<li>VOICE COMMANDS</li>
<li>ALERTS</li>
<li>UPDATE</li>
<li>EXPERIMENTAL</li>
<li>ABOUT</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see a picture of the first five screens by clicking the appropriate button below.</p>
<h2>SOUNDS</h2>
<img src="Images/Sounds.png" />
<p>The first option you will be presented with is the sound settings feature. The upper part of the screen displays the current sound settings, and allows you to select a sound to modify. The lower portion of the screen allows you to change the settings of the selected sound. To play the selected sound, click the "TEST" button.</p>
<p>Each sound can be enabled or disabled, and have the file used by the sound changed. For most sounds, one of several built-in sound resources can be selected, or any external .wav file. The only exception is the button beep sound, which may only have the default sound selected as a resource. If for any reason the selected file is not valid, the sound will reset to the default.</p>
<p>The following sounds are available</p>
<ul>
<li>Button beep: The sound played whenever a button is clicked or touched (if you have a touch screen)</li>
<li>Listening for command: The sound played whenever speech recognition is waiting for a command</li>
<li>Confirm command: The sound played whenever speech recognition is waiting for command confirmation</li>
<li>Command timed out: The sound played whenever speech recognition stops listening due to a timeout</li>
</ul>
<h2>APPEARANCE</h2>
<img src="Images/Appearance.png" />
<p>The appearance tab is used to set the preferred colour scheme and the “Use Star date” feature that controls the clock display.</p>
<p>A choice of colour scheme is included and clicking a scheme in the list will alter the key above and show you what you can expect LCARS x32 to look like.</p>
<p>An editor is available which allows you to create your own colour schemes. It is called Colormapper and is available from the incremental build section of the Download area in the LCARS x32 website.</p>
<p>The “Use Stardate” Button changes the clock display and the display of dates and times in LCARS Explorer. With the mode OFF the current day, month, year and time are displayed. With the feature switched on the current stardate is displayed.</p>
<h2>SCREEN-SPECIFIC</h2>
<img src="Images/Screen-Specific_Main.png" />
<p>This section contains settings that only apply to a single display on systems with multiple monitors. The display selection screen shows the <em>logical</em> arrangement of the displays, and may have no relation to their physical arrangement.</p>
<h3>WALLPAPER</h3>
<img src="Images/Desktop.png" />
<p>The wallpaper feature is used to set up the default working area desktop display. You can use the United Federation of Planets Logo that is included with the software or you can use your own wallpaper instead.</p>
<p>Zoom, stretch, center and tile options are provided to help you position your wallpaper.</p>
<p>In Windows 7 or 8, when the Windows desktop is set to display a rotating sequence of images the LCARS desktop may not cover it completely. This can be solved by disabling the slideshow desktop.</p>
<h3>MAIN SCREEN</h3>
<img src="Images/Screen-Specific_Main_Screen.png" />
<p>The Auto hide feature is used when full screen mode for applications is required. The LCARS x32 menu buttons and display are largely hidden unless the mouse is moved off screen.</p>
<h3>LANGUAGE FILE</h3>
<img src="Images/Language.png" />
<p>The language alters the labelling of buttons and functions within LCARS x32's main screens only. When you click a language in the list, a key above will change to show you how the buttons and functions will look.</p>
<p>A new language file can be created using an editor available at the LCARS resource site where the current release was hosted, or by editing a copy of Standard.lng with your favourite text editor.</p>
<h2>STARTUP</h2>
<img src="Images/Startup.png" />
<p>The start-up tab is used to set the default shell for the current user. Users who prefer to use Windows Explorer as the default shell can do so and LCARS x32 will function as a replacement desktop that can be activated and de-activated as required.</p>
<h2>VOICE COMMANDS</h2>
<p>Due to the complexity of the voice command system, it has its own <a href="Voice Commands.htm">page</a>.</p>
<h2>ALERTS</h2>
<p>Due to the complexity of the alert system in LCARS x32, it has its own <a href="Alerts.htm">page</a>.</p>
<h2>UPDATE</h2>
<img src="Images/Update.png" />
<p>Auto-updates are designed to simplify the distribution of bugfixes and new features. Normally no settings on this page will need to be changed. LCARS x32 will check for updates at startup, or whenever the "Manual Check" button is clicked. Depending on what type of build you installed, LCARS x32 will be configured to check either the experimental or stable release update channels. At this time, there is no stable release with updates, so that option is disabled. It is important to note that you MUST have administrator access to install updates.</p>
<p>There is an option to install updates from a custom update server. Any updates installed in this manner are the property of their creators, and are installed at your own risk! If you wish to set up your own custom update server, please make a request for directions through the forums at <a href="http://www.lcarsx32.com">www.lcarsx32.com</a>.</p>
<p>Setting the debug switch will allow you to see exactly which server the updates are being pulled from. This is helpful because LCARS x32 will normally select from a list of servers at random.</p>
<h2>EXPERIMENTAL</h2>
<img src="Images/Experimental.png" />
<p>Any options which are considered highly unpredictable will be placed here. Any documentation of those functions will be on their settings screen. All experimental functions are off by default, and may operate with unpredictable results when turned on. Unless you have a specific reason to, DO NOT use these functions.</p>
<h3>Debug Switch</h3>
<p>This switch is designed to allow easier troubleshooting of several features, but also enables such things as intentional crashing. If you turn it on, turn off voice commands for safety unless you want to initiate a crash intentionally.</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<img src="Images/About.png" />
<p>This section gives credit to everyone who has had a hand in the development of LCARS x32 and the developers of external libraries used by LCARS x32.</p>
